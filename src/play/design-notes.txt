Need margin in/out hubnote to reduce provider's moving out of hubnote (change sharding key value)
micro-service vs normal similar to asyn-js vs syn-js (observable pattern, parallel)
start up: create topic if not existing
setup producer, consumer.
hub service handler before provider service, then place result message
each service method is a kafka topic
it's hard to use ksql for parallel --> use header with embeded data.
The main idea of HMS streaming is use Kafka message headers to attach info, forward to dependencies services, 
then receive back result with previous data in header, then now process it.
For ex: tracking provider need hubservice.maphub

split/accumulate nodes
assign consumer to partition scaling

using completefuture to chain --> sync processing

key range of synchronized
generic hell --> split read/write by abstract, descrete.

service-gateway --> k8 api to manage pods
kafka api to manage topics
- tracking: 1 partition, multiple groups
- query: multiple partitions, 1 group.
